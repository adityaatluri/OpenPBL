numSpecLobes for each BSDFSamplesStruct is a number (single entry variable). Which is, number of Number of lobes

The number of samples per lobe is stored in an array  numLobeSamples.
Here, we limit all the samples per lobe to 1024 designated as NUM_SAMPLES. Array length which is numSpecLobes to 1024 designated as NUM_LOBES.

NUM_SAMPLES = numLobeSamples;
NUM_LOBES = numSpecLobes;
The actual variable is numSpecularBRDFs. This is our actual thread on GPU. 

Here, we assume that, each SpecularBRDF is assigned to each point in the scene (each vertex).
